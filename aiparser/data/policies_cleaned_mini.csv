Commercial Reimbursement Policy Subject: Modifier Usage – Professional Policy Number: C- Policy Section: Coding Last Approval Date: 06/03/2025 Effective Date: 06/03/2025 Disclaimer These reimbursement policies serve as a guide to assist you in accurate claims submissions and to outline the basis for reimbursement if the service is covered by a member’s benefit plan. The determination that a service, procedure, or item is covered under a member's benefit plan is not a determination that you will be reimbursed. Services must also meet authorization and medical necessity guidelines appropriate to the procedure and diagnosis, as well as to the member’s state of residence. Ensure that you use proper billing and submission guidelines, including industry-standard, compliant codes on all claim submissions. Services should be billed with Current Procedure Terminology (CPT) codes, Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes and/or revenue codes. These codes denote the services and/or procedures performed and when billed, must be fully supported in the medical record and/or office notes. Unless otherwise noted within the policy, our reimbursement policies apply to both participating and non- participating professional providers and facilities. If appropriate coding/billing guidelines or current reimbursement policies are not followed, we may: • Reject or deny the claim. • Recover and/or recoup claim payment. These reimbursement policies may be superseded by mandates in provider, state, federal, or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) contracts and/or requirements. We strive to minimize delays in policy implementation. If there is a delay, we reserve the right to recoup and/or recover claims payment to the effective date, in accordance with the policy. We reserve the right to review and revise these policies when necessary. When there is an update, we will publish the most current policy to the website.

Anthem is a registered trademark of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc. Policy The health plan allows reimbursement for covered services provided to eligible members when billed with appropriate procedure codes and appropriate modifiers when applicable unless provider, state, or federal contracts and/or requirements indicate otherwise. Reimbursement is based on the code-set combinations submitted with the correct modifiers. The use of certain modifiers requires the provider to submit supporting documentation along with the claim. Refer to the specific modifier policies for guidance on documentation submission. We reserve the right to review adherence to correct coding for high-volume modifiers. Applicable electronic or paper claims billed without the correct modifier in the correct format may be rejected or denied. The modifier must be in capital letters, if alpha or alphanumeric. Rejected or denied claims must be resubmitted with the correct modifier in conjunction with the code-set to be considered for reimbursement. Corrected and resubmitted claims are subject to timely filing guidelines. The use of correct modifiers does not guarantee reimbursement. Reimbursement Modifiers Reimbursement modifiers affect payment and denote circumstances when an increase or reduction is appropriate for the service provided. The modifiers must be billed in the primary or first modifier field locator. Informational Modifiers Impacting Reimbursement Informational modifiers determine if the service provided will be reimbursed or denied. Modifiers that impact reimbursement should be billed in modifier locator fields after reimbursement modifiers, if any. Informational Modifiers Not Impacting Reimbursement Informational modifiers are used for documentation purposes. Modifiers that do not impact reimbursement should be billed in the subsequent modifier field locators. We reserve the right to reorder modifiers to reimburse correctly for services provided.

OVERVIEW This policy relates to genetic and biomarker tests that aim to screen for specific cancers in individuals who are at risk to develop them. These screening tests can be designed for asymptomatic individuals that are at an average risk level for cancer, or for individuals that are known to be at a higher risk to develop a specific cancer. Genetic and biomarker cancer screening tests aim to identify the presence of cancer before symptoms appear and when treatment is often most effective. These tests are not currently diagnostic for cancer, but typically determine if an individual has an increased chance that cancer is present. Screening tests for colorectal cancer may be performed by analyzing specific DNA present in fecal matter or peripheral blood. Cancer screening tests may also be performed on urine samples to screen for bladder cancer and colon polyps. These methods offer a noninvasive alternative to currently available screening approaches such as colonoscopy. Screening tests for lung cancer are potentially useful adjuncts to the low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), a recommended lung cancer screening tool in high-risk populations. Biomarkers such as autoantibodies, metabolites, proteins, and microRNA may be sampled from many different bodily sources, including whole blood, serum, plasma, bronchial brushings, and sputum. Circulating blood-based and serum based biomarkers are convenient samples as they are relatively easy and inexpensive to collect. It is important to note that screening tests are not diagnostic tests. The results from a screening test put an individual into a lower risk or higher risk status. For an individual that is put into the higher risk status, following up with an appropriate diagnostic test would be necessary to make a definitive diagnosis of cancer. For lung cancer, approaches where a biomarker based initial screen is followed by LDCT, or in which a biomarker test is combined with LDCT, show promise for use in early detection. However, more high quality evidence is needed to support and guide the implementation of these tests.

The use of FIT-DNA Testing (stool DNA testing) () to screen for colorectal cancer may be considered medically necessary when: A. The member/enrollee is 45 years of age or older, AND B. The member/enrollee is an individual who is at average risk for colorectal cancer, because the member/enrollee does not have any of the following: 1. A personal history of colorectal cancer or adenoma or sessile serrated polyp, OR 2. A family history of colorectal cancer in close relatives, OR 3. A personal history of inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease), OR 4. A personal history of cystic fibrosis, OR 5. A confirmed or suspected hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non- polyposis colon cancer or HNPCC), OR 6. A personal history of receiving radiation to the abdomen (belly) or pelvic area to treat a prior cancer. II. The use of FIT-DNA Testing (stool DNA testing) () to screen for colorectal cancer is considered investigational for all other indications. NOTE: Fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) alone is not in the scope of this policy (see definitions) back to top Urinary Biomarker Tests for Pre-cancerous Polyps I. The use of urinary biomarker tests for pre-cancerous polyps (0002U) is considered investigational. back to top Concert Genetic Oncology: Cancer Screening V1. 2025 Date of Last Revision: 11/2024 5 Blood-based Biomarker Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests I.

The use of blood-based biomarker tests for lung cancer screening are considered investigational. back to top DEFINITIONS 1. Fecal immunohistochemical testing (FIT): Screening test for colon cancer that detects human blood in the lower intestines. (FIT testing alone does not involve any genetic test and is outside of the scope of this policy). 2. FIT-DNA test: Combination of the fecal immunochemical (FIT), which uses antibodies to detect blood in the stool, with a test that detects abnormal DNA from cancer or polyp cells in the stool. 3. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT): Proposed as a method of screening asymptomatic, high risk individuals for lung cancer, it refers to a non contrast study with a multi-detector CT scanner during a single maximal inspiratory breath-hold with a scanning time of under 25 seconds. It has been suggested that LDCT may be an improved early lung cancer detection tool based on the advantages it appears to have over CXR and sputum cytology to detect lung cancer at an earlier stage. 4. MicroRNAs (miRNAs): Tissue specific, small, non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression which may identify candidates for early detection of lung cancer. back to top Concert Genetic Oncology: Cancer Screening V1. 2025 Date of Last Revision: 11/2024 6 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE COLON CANCER SCREENING TESTS FIT-DNA Testing (Stool DNA Testing) National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Current NCCN guidelines on Colorectal Cancer Screening (1. 2024) support the use of FIT-DNA for colorectal cancer screening in average-risk individuals aged 45-75 with a life expectancy greater than or equal to 10 years, and notes that the decision to screen individuals aged 76-85 should be individualized. (p. CSCR-1A). The choice of screening modality should be based on patient preference and availability after discussion. (p. CSCR-1). Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Cologuard (Exact Sciences): On August 12, 2014, Cologuard (Exact Sciences) was approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the premarket approval process as an automated fecal DNA testing product (P130017). Cologuard is intended for the qualitative detection of colorectal neoplasia associated with DNA markers and occult hemoglobin in human stool. A positive result may indicate the presence of CRC or advanced adenoma and should be followed by diagnostic colonoscopy. (p. 1) On September 20, 2019, the FDA approved the expansion of the Cologuard label to include adults ages 45 years or older. Cologuard was previously indicated for those aged 50 years or older. Cologuard is not a replacement for diagnostic colonoscopy or surveillance colonoscopy in high- risk individuals. Urinary Biomarker Tests for Pre-cancerous Colon Polyps National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Current NCCN guidelines on Colon Cancer Screening (1. 2024) do not include a recommendation for colorectal cancer screening via urine-based screening. Concert Genetic Oncology: Cancer Screening V1. 2025 Date of Last Revision: 11/2024 7 There is insufficient evidence to support the use of this test. No recommendations for or against this testing within standard professional society guidelines covering this area of testing were identified. Blood-based Biomarker Colorectal Cancer Screening Tests Concert Evidence Review for Coverage Determination (Published 12/21/2023) Multiple studies have been published on BeScreened, FirstSight CRC, ColonSentry, Epi proColon, Colovantage, ColoScape Colorectal Cancer Detection, and Guardant Shield and their ability to screen for increased risk of colorectal cancer, including several meta-analyses and validation studies. Most of these studies include a measure of clinical validity measured by sensitivity and specificity, and several studies compared these measures to those of colonoscopy, FIT or FOBT testing. The evidence for clinical validity does not consistently demonstrate superior sensitivity or specificity for these tests across studies. This lack of consistency highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism of these biomarkers in colorectal cancer in order to explain the observed variability. Further, there is limited evidence to demonstrate that these tests promote a safe and effective alternative to colonoscopy or useful screening test to prioritize patients who should get colonoscopies. While the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) address blood-based tests for colon cancer screening in their most recent recommendations, neither recommend the testing. At the present time, blood-based biomarker tests such as BeScreened, FirstSight CRC, ColonSentry, Epi proColon, Colovantage, ColoScape Colorectal Cancer Detection and Guardant Shield have INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE in peer-reviewed publications to effectively result in improved health outcomes compared to the current standard of care. LUNG CANCER SCREENING TESTS Blood-based Biomarker Lung Cancer Screening Tests National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Current NCCN guidelines on Lung Cancer Screening (2. 2024) do not include a recommendation for lung cancer screening via blood-based or micro-RNA based screening. Current NCCN guidelines support lung cancer screening using LDCT for individuals with high risk factors.
