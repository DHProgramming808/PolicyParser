Appendix E: Appropriate Experimental Design Methods â€¢ Randomized, prospective controlled trials are generally considered the gold standard, however: o In some clinical studies, it may be unnecessary or not feasible to use randomization, double-blind trials, placebos, or crossover. o Non-randomized prospective clinical trials with a significant number of subjects may be a basis for supportive clinical evidence for determining accepted uses of drugs. CLINICAL POLICY Fremanezumab-vfrm Page 5 of 7 â€¢ Case reports and chart reviews are generally considered uncontrolled and anecdotal information and do not provide adequate supportive clinical evidence for determining accepted uses of drugs.
